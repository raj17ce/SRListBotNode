#### â€¢ This is a telegram bot based on NodeJS. It was a freelance project I developed for [Stock Region](https://www.stockregion.net/).

## Functionalities

- The list contains the name of the tickers along with the percentage gain or lose in the regular market.

- Multiple user can use the bot at the same time.

## TechStack
